FIT2099 S2 2021 Assignment


Throughout the 3-4 months in 2021, I worked in a team of 3 to modify and extend a game (Under the theme of Souls-like) given a solid foundation to start with. Our goal was to add new elements to the game that respect the principles and rules of Object Oriented Design using Java as the given language. This also includes UML diagrams in order to carefully plan our approach when implementing new things or modifying the game.
